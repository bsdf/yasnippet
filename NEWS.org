* 0.9.1 (est. February 2016)
** New features

*** =yas-key-syntaxes= is much more powerful and accepts functions

    Enables use cases when discovering keys based on buffer syntax is
    not good enough. See issue #497.

*** Documentation rewritten in org-mode and updated

    A tremendous effort by Noam Postavsky. Hopefully easier to
    maintain and navigate. Available at
    http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet/.

*** Snippets are now maintained in their own repo

    Snippets live in Andrea Crotti's
    =https://github.com/andreacrotti/yasnippet-snippets=. See
    README.md for more details.

*** Textmate snippet imported moved to separate =yasmate= repo

    URL is =https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasmate=. See README.md
    for more details.

*** =yas-snippet-dirs= now allows symbols as aliases to directories

    The added level of indirection should allow more esoteric
    configurations. See Github #495.

*** =yas-reload-all= can now jit-load when called interactively

*** Tests run automatically in the Travis CI system

*** New =yas-after-reload-hook= run after =yas-reload-all=

    See https://github.com/pezra/rspec-mode/pull/75 for the
    discussion leading up to this change.

*** New functions =yas-activate-extra-mode= and =yas-deactivate-extra-mode=

    These are preferable to setting =yas-extra-modes= directly in the
    mode hook. See issue #420 for more information.

*** New variable =yas-new-snippet-default=

    The default snippet suggested on =yas-new-snippet= can now be
    customized.

** Fixed bugs
   
   # TODO: harvest most "Fix XXX" references from the comments and add
   # each as a single heading. A googlecode tracker bug should be "Fix
   # Googlecode 123" whereas a github tracker bug should be "Fix Github
   # #123". If a summarized description can be done in a few words, add
   # it, otherwise don't care.

*** Github #527, #525 and #526: Attempt to prevent "fallback loops"

    When interactiing with other extensions that use similar fallback
    mechanisms.

* 0.8.0 (August 2012)

** New features

*** All YASnippet symbols being with =yas-=. Keep old =yas/= versions as aliases

*** Yasnippet is now Free Software Foundation's copyright

*** =yas-dont-activate= can be a list of functions

*** Snippets are loaded just-in-time 

    Thanks to Matthew Fidler for a lot of input with the implementation.

*** =yasnippet-bundle.el= is no longer available

    Use =yas-compile-directory= instead if you need the speed advantage.

*** New functions =yas-compile-directory= and  =yas-recompile-all=

    This feature is still undocumented.  Generate a
    =.yas-compiled-snippets.el= file in the directory passed where
    snippets are compiled into emacs-lisp code.

*** New =yas-verbosity= variable

*** Interactively calling =yas-exit-snippet= exist most recently inserted snippet

*** Using filenames as snippet triggers is deprecated

*** Default value of =yas-show-menu-p= is =abbreviate=

*** =yas-visit-snippet= ignores =yas-prompt-functions=

*** =yas-buffer-local-condition=  restricted to trigger-key expansions by default

*** =yas-load-snippet-buffer= (=C-c C-c=) in =snippet-mode= has been much improved

*** New variable =yas-expand-only-for-last-commands=, thanks Erik Postma

*** New variable =yas-extra-modes= aliases old =yas/mode-symbol=

*** New =yas-describe-tables= command

*** New =yas-define-condition-cache= macro

    This defines an optimised function for placing in a =#
    condition:= directive that will run at most once per
    snippet-expansion attempt.

*** Mirrors can occur inside fields

*** New =# type: command= directive

    This feature is still largely undocumented.

*** A hidden =.yas-setup.el= is loaded if found in a snippet directory

*** =yas/wrap-around-region= can now also be =cua= (undocumented feature)

*** Make menu groups automatically using new  =.yas-make-groups= file

*** Per-snippet keybindings using =# keybinding:= directive

*** More friendly =yas/expand-snippet= calling convention

    This breaks backward compatibility.

*** The =# env:= directive is now =# expand-env:=

*** Setup multiple parent modes using new =.yas-parents= file

** Fixed bugs

*** Github #281: jit-load snippets in the correct order

*** Github #245: primary field transformations work inside nested fields

*** Github #242: stop using the deprecated =assoc= library

*** Github #233: show direct snippet keybindings in the menu

*** Github #194, Googlecode 192: Compatibility with =fci-mode=

*** Github #147, Googlecode 145: Snippets comments were getting inserted

*** Github #141, Googlecode 139: searching buffer in embedded elisp works slightly better

    Issue is still open for analysis, though

*** Github #95, Googlecode 193: no more stack overflow in org-mode

*** Github #285, #248
